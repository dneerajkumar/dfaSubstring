TC++(Turbo C++) DFA Machine Simulator

Hello TC++ Lovers!!

This Snippets gives you the basic simulation of the DFA(Deterministic Finite Automata) Machine which accepts the string which contains substring "1010" over alphabet set = {0,1}

Basic Idea : 
The Control will scan through the user provided string one by one charcter form left to right and takes a decision and reaches to a particular state either a final state or a 
non-final state by looking to the currently scanned input symbol. If the control encounters the given string is scanned successfully and the state of the machine is in any
one of the final state then the string is said to be "accepted" by the machine if not then the string will be considered as "Rejcted" any illegal symbol (except 0,1) will cause
the machine to directly reject the string with out further scanning to the input string.

Note: This Code Will Only Work With Turbo C++ Complier Only :)

Here are some of the snapshots of the application
